# Execute any JS in Screen Flows. Work around the limitations of flows using JS

Convert strings in flows to arrays/collections, concat, use map, reduce, filters, and more..!.

Use Invocable Actions to serialize record collections and deserialize them back after processing. So flows can now be as simple as `Get Records -> Serialize -> Process using JS -> Deserialize -> Update Records`. Avoid loops and make your flows more linear. A sample flow is included.

Gif will be updated soon!
